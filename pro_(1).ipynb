              " 'this is my second time buying cellphone from amazon as always did heavy research before buying the phone and placing my order my first impression of the phone was holy crap this is beautiful its thin its slick and it is black and shiny all over the place it is really something to admire the first thing is this phone is huge its totally thing and it wont stop being thing mean it is 5 5 inch screen which makes this phone almost tablet which it is so it is called phablet the screen is very bright crisp and seriously ips in my opinion the best choice for color and brightness plus it saves battery people complains that this phone doesn have 1080p screen but really if you can see the difference between the pixel density of this phone aprox 200ppi and the pixel density of the iphone 500 ppi then your eyes must be better than the kepler telescope go work at nasa or some stuff hehehehe the screen size alone makes up for some things it is missing and it totally should have like magnetometer but don get me wrong this lil fella here is powerhouse it will make some phat rhymes and some ill beats for you if you play it rightthe feel of the phone is sturdy it wont broke easily nor recommend you to try and break it mean come on the back case has good grip still recommend you to get phone cover just in case tpu will do or something more sturdier got one from http www amazon com gp product b00ey7ss72 ref cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1it has lcd screen cover plus the case inside the box got the phone durrrrr charger battery screen cover 4 gb micro sd usb cable wall adapter and some cool earphones really complete set in my opinion it has the bare minimum to go strolling the charger is of good quality sturdy as is the usb cable and the wall adapter about the battery it is 2250 mah battery now in the last two weeks only charged the phone once every 2 days so that gives you an approximate of 2 days of battery with gps wifi and data network on but that me don play much with the phone and my heavy using apps are social ones there is an application on the phone called lenovo power that manages battery in smart way so it lasts longer suggest to learn it and use it ok opening the back case is nothing short of easy it has little dent to the lower right side that allows you to pull the back case fast and easy inside you will find 2 standard sized sim card slots micro sd slot up to 32 gb phone camera audio speakers and battery slot the phone accepts mini sim cards too now about the dual sim you must know that the first one the one on the left is able to use 3g capabilities while the other one cannot don sweat it this is standard practice the second sim card slot will be and shall be used for second phone line used only for calls the audio speaker is of good quality and loud good lord that thing is noisy hehehe this phone id is lenovo a850 its not lenovo a820 and it is totally not samsung galaxy 2 3 or 4 nevertheless it has bunch of qualities that will prove quite useful why do mention that you ask it is because of the camera kid you not its 5 mp camera its really good camera but some people might want this phone to shoot pictures at quality that is beyond the hardware the pictures are excellent in my opinion and they will work with whats app and other apps it has lot of modes like continuous shooting and auto focus and you can set up camera quality up to 5 mp you can record video at high quality too it seems 1080p but in fact it is scaled from lesser resolution not problem for me tho as always this is phone not camera this phone has mt6582m mediatek cpu it is quad core 1 3 ghz with gpu mali 400mp2 what does this means for you its fast trust me really fast your multimedia will play with no problems and your games will go like silk games like nova 3 and anomaly korea cool it has 4 gb of internal memory that translates in total of 2 31 gb in real usable space it has too 1 gb of ram this will make the phone faster too because you will be multitasking lot with this phone now going to the front side of the phone you will find in the top the brand of the phone lenovo in shiny silver letters your 3 5 audio plug power button speaker frontal camera proximity sensor and notification led the frontal camera is 1 2 mp one it wont transmit lots of data to skype and other apps so its ideal to make video calls the top speaker works like charm as well as the proximity sensor and the 4 colors notification led blue red orange green guess the led is fully configurable but haven tried it yet will update as possible in the bottom you will find 3 silver shiny soft touch buttons micro usb slot and microphone the soft buttons are from left to right menu button home button and go back button they are shiny and silver and they wont have back light they will be visible enough in the darkness so that it the right side of the phone has the volume buttons the left side has nothing ok that with the physical stuff now we go to software first thing first this phone posses high grade of heavy customization and as such it is necessary that if you are going to make use it you are able to at least follow instructions precisely and know your way around android os or computer sorry but that it if you want to customize it if not then don worry most sellers are very kind and they will get you if you ask them of course the phone in your language be it spanish or english or whatevs and they will customize it for you but seriously ask them don expect them to do it just for giggles and certainly do not ask after getting the phone or placing the order before is ok the software is tricky thing my phone came with android 4 2 2 rom that is called s128 xiaomijie it was chinese rom but it came in english just wiped it and installed another one called s121 made by linerty its more stable for me ill post the links at the end for you all that want to customize the phone there is silver lining to this there is an announce from mediatek that this phone will get android 4 4 kitkat at the end of this month 18 04 2014 as today so if you go trough with the rom change you will get the experience needed to update to kitkat later all this will be done manually bollocks anyways android 4 2 goes really fast in this phone man so fast you will get lot of apps that will make your experience with this phone something worth sharing your live wallpapers will be smooth your wireless will be fast and your calls will always go trough the android integration is really cool and it will save you lots of trouble when you set up your apn because at the time you insert your sim card it will get all the info you need for it the gps is really exact you will get accurate measures up to 2 meters you wont need internet connection for it to work only when you download your maps but apart from that no this phone works excellently in venezuela it works with movilnet and movistar sim card 1 and with digitel sim card 2 that for gsm calls for 3g and data connection its only the sim card 1 over all this phone is great purchase give it 10 10 points because the sheer awesomeness have in mind that this is mid end phone and it kicks some rump about the seller it was lightinthebox they sent directly from china via dhl it was fast shipment for me communicated with themand they were always attentive and fast at answering id go with them again in any case at the time bought the phone it was worth 169 guess it will get cheaper so get it if you can done thing you must remember this is no samsung s5 s4 phone nor an iphone not tablet but it will prove reliable with office applications and such have nice day thanks for reading this 18 04 2014 ',\n",
